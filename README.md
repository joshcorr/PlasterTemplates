# PlasterTemplates

These are a few [plaster](https://github.com/PowerShellOrg/Plaster) templates I developed to speed up the creation of functions, Powershell modules built with Jenkins, or [poshBot](https://github.com/poshbotio/PoshBot) plugins. Each example has its own README.md to provide some context.

> These are all provided ***as-is*** to the PowerShell community as examples of how various functions work in Plaster.
